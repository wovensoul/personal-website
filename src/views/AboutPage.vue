    hello! my name is jeffrey but you can call me jeff! for the last two years i was a software
    engineer at a startup called Pupil, where we connect underrepresented students with mentors to
    help them thrive.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-3">
    lately, i’ve been focused on front-end development, but i’m also really into backend and enjoy
    exploring native and cross-platform app tech.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-3">
    on the side, i’m building projects like matchaluv, a matcha-themed social app, with plans to add
    ai-powered features like personalized matcha recipes!
  </p>
  <p class="mt-3">
    i still have plenty to learn, and i’m always open to connect and chat about tech, projects, or
    whatever’s trending! Heels, nails, blade, mascara (bonus points if you get the reference)!
  </p>
  <p class="mt-3">
    When I'm not coding, I love listening to kpop, ice skating and enjoy trying new foods around the
    city!
